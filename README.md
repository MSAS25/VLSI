# VLSI
In this project, we designed a simple Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Hardware Description Language (HDL), capable of performing two operations:  op1: AND,_XOR,_OR (combined module),  op2: ADD (arithmetic operation) of 5 5-bit word size. The ALU was implemented through modular design with the following files:  ALU.v, ALU_tb.v, op1.v, op2.v. Use the  All_commands.s file for using commands for running in Ubuntu. It is good to run in VirtualBox.
